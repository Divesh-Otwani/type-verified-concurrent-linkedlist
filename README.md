# CS356Lab8

This is a private repo for my lab 8 final project. 
Essentialy, I implement a singly linked list
with some (not a lot) typed verification
to ensure that the list remains ordered.


## The Typed Interface



## Design


* Only one non-trivial cast: In insert of LL. It's also stupid



## Sources

* See here for [general type level stuff.](https://brianmckenna.org/blog/evenodd_agda_idris_haskell_scala)
* I've found [context bounds](https://gist.github.com/retronym/257758/47f06f2f3ca47702b3a86c76a5479d096cb8c7ec) these to be useful.
* Insane help from Alexander Konovalov @alexknvl on the scala/scala forum at https://gitter.im/scala/scala?source=orgpage

* Should list all the other people on the scala chat forums that helped me
