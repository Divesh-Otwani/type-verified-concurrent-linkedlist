package ChatRoom


/*

In this file, I explain the tersely documented
example akka gives on "Akka Typed"

 The idea of the example is to implement a chatroom.
 There is a chatroom actor that holds a list of
 actorRefs called sessions that it can send out
 messages to.

 The chatroom can recieve `Command`s. It will
 accumulate a list of ActorRef[SessionEvent]'s.

 It will accept some `GetSession` requests and
 reject others. Once accepted, that actor will be notified
 and it can then send a PostMessage to the actorRef they
 were given. That, through some convertion thing
 is converted into a PostSessionMessage command
 that is sent to the chatroom actor and the chatroom
 actor just sends all it's sessions that message.

 Below, we completely define the interface in types.

sealed trait Command
final case class
  GetSession(screenName: String, replyTo: ActorRef[SessionEvent])
  extends Command
sealed trait SessionEvent
final case class
  SessionGranted(handle: ActorRef[PostMessage])
    extends SessionEvent
final case class
  SessionDenied(reason: String) extends SessionEvent
final case class
  MessagePosted(screenName: String, message: String)
    extends SessionEvent

private final case class
  PostSessionMessage(screenName: String, message: String)

/*

 As I see it, Behavior[Interface] is a superclass
 of Stateless[Interface] and Stateful[Interface].

 The first argument is the context.

 The interface allows

 1) ctx.spawn(Behavior[Interface], String): ActorRef[Interface]
     to add an actor

2) ctx.spawnAdapter {p: SomeType => {expression that evaluates
 to something that actor can deal with, an inst of it's
 interface}} : ActorRef[SomeType]

 creates one actor child and returns an actorRef to it.
 When this child recieves messages, it converts them
 to a type that the current actor supports and forwards them.
 It is an adapter.

3) ctx.watch() which apparently watches for an actors's
 death and sends a Terminated(ActorRef) when it dies.
 I think (not sure) only an actor of type Behavior[akka.NotUsed]
 can watch actors.

object Main extends App {


  def chatRoom
    (sessions: List[ActorRef[SessionEvent]] = List.empty)
      : Behavior[Command] =
    Stateful[Command] { (ctx, msg) =>
      msg match {
        case GetSession(screenName, client) =>
          val wrapper = ctx.spawnAdapter {
            p: PostMessage =>
              PostSessionMessage(screenName, p.message)
          }
          client ! SessionGranted(wrapper)
          chatRoom(client :: sessions)
          // this ^ was a recursive call
          // to return a new actor that
          // just has another session.
          // :: is Cons
        case PostSessionMessage(screenName, message) =>
          val mp = MessagePosted(screenName, message)
          sessions foreach (_ ! mp)
          Same
      }
    }

/*

 As I understand it, an Stateful[Interface] actor
 is constructed just like a Stateless[Interface] actor,
 by using the name as a constructor:
   Stateless[Interface] {
     (ctx, msg) => {x: Stateful[Interface]}
   }

   except now, the return value of the `recieve` is a new
   actor of the same type/interface. Further,
   Stateless actors die when the system is shut down.
   Here you can stop actors; see below.


   For this, some syntax is given:
     `Same` means the actor remains
     `Stopped` means the actor is going to die now
      without processing any more messages.

      `Unhandled` means what you think it means.
